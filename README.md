# Hotel Management System in Java
Hotel Management System is written with the help of a tutorial to practice my зкщпкфььштп skills in Java Programming Language. It is a Hotel Management tool that can be used to manage activities like storing customer details, booking rooms of four different types, ordering food for particular rooms, unbooking rooms and showing the bill. It can also be used to see different room features and room availability. It is a menu-driven program, and it runs until the user exits. File handling has been used to store the current status of the hotel(customer details, booked rooms, food ordered) in a file once the program exits so that when we restart the program, the old details are not lost.
